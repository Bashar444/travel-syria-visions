# ✅ SINGLE BRANCH DEPLOYMENT - MASTER DELETED

## Status: FIXED ✅

**Date**: November 9, 2025  
**Branch**: main (ONLY)  
**Status**: Ready for Vercel deployment

## What Was Fixed

### **Problem**
- Two branches (main & master) confusing Vercel
- Vercel not detecting master branch
- Deployment failing

### **Solution**
1. ✅ **Deleted master branch locally**
2. ✅ **Deleted master branch from GitHub**
3. ✅ **Kept main as the only deployment branch**
4. ✅ **All UX improvements merged into main**
